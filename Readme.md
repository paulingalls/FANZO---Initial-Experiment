FANZO - initial experiment

On the surface this is a simple website that allows users to head off to launch rocket to signup to hear more about FANZO.

BUT, underneath this is a hacked up version of the heroku php facebook app that's been modified to work with twitter.  
At this point the facebook stuff is still there in case we want to experiment with it at a later date.

The purpose of this experiment was to play with what it felt like to watch the twitter stream for a specific game, 
as identified by the team hashtags.  Pick a game, watch the stream.  Cool?

It also incorporates some simple random tweet generation code based on a few user interactions.  If it only takes a
few clicks/touches will more people tweet during the game?

Those were two of the first hypothesis we wanted to test.  The test ran during the NCAA tourney in 2012.
